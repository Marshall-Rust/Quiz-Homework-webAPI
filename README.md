Having issues getting this to work. Found some code online and attempted to get it to work. Broke more stuff. Now i cant get the questions to push to local store or save HS.
I made 2 JS files to herlp me keep them different so i could focus on one at a time. I found some code onloine to help me out. I couldnt finsh this in time.
