Having issues getting this to work. Found some code online and attempted to get it to work. Broke more stuff. Now i cant get the questions to push to local store or save HS.
I made 2 JS files to herlp me keep them different so i could focus on one at a time. I found some code onloine to help me out. I couldnt finsh this in time.
Got the timer to work. questions to work. score page. couldnt get the score to transfer. couldnt submit score. or anything like that. really struggled with this and thought i would of done better.
